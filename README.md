# administrationsystem
a simulation of an administration system

WELCOME! 
this a simulation of an administration system, basically a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

Bellow, i going to explain how can you run this script without any problem, in this case i going to use Linux, but the steps are almost the same in anothers operational systems!

### ðŸ”§ Installation

After make a clone in the script you will have to download Python 3 if you don't have

```
sudo apt-get install python3
```
after that, you have to open your terminal (CTRL+ALT+T), find the place that you had done the clone (you can use the command "cd"), and open the paste. Then, just type:

```
python3 main.py
```
